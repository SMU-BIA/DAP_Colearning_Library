# Pre DAP readings

## Circa 2026 (the 11th batch of DAP)

These are readings for 3 separate groups that I'm currently mentoring or have associations with, and that I think will be relevant for everyone.

I just hope that this encourages other mentors to also share some resources in a similar capacity, so that everyone can benefit and contribute.

The groups that I am involved with are:

- For the 11th Run of DAP:

    - **Legal NLP** with Chaithra, Harini and Ryan
    - **Product lifespan-centric recommender systems** with Raphael, Wee Siang, Terry
    - **Face anonymization and replacement for privacy protection** with Pauline, Dexter and Kenneth
